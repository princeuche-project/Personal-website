                and 60% of our running clothes and shoe sales are accompanied by an additional

                To achieve a net profit of N2,000,000.00 by year two and N6,000,000 by year five.

                    Provide customers with top-notch personalized customer service in an atmosphere of

                    Advertise and promote in all areas so that our customer base will learn more about <br>
                    PUGO clothing and shoe boutique
                    Continuously review our inventory and sales and adjust our inventory levels accordingly.

                    Most importantly, always stay on top of the latest trends in the style of women’s clothes
                    and shoes.

                    future.
                    This will be the most cost effective arrangement, yet provide the requisite amount
                    of service and support.

                <h2>The concept</h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing that the market for quality shoes in extended sizes is quite competitive using the
                    larger shoe retailers,
                    <strong>PUGO</strong> clothing and shoe boutique will minimize the competition by targeting
                    specific niches, generally
                    focusing on other retail stores whose prices are too expensive, lack quality and are not “shoe
                    and clothe size efficient”.
                    <em>PUGO</em> clothing and shoe boutique has three keys to success. The first is establishing a
                    high quality, high value
                    relationship with its vendors and customers. The second key is to ensure reliable and timely
                    delivery of their products.
                    The last key to success is reliable administration of the organization. This boutique business
                    plan is intended to
                    provide the structure to make sure this last key to success is realized.
