The experience of function are very important in programming. They help you to easily refer back tp your code and make any necessary changes.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process of troubleshooting my program is by looking to the terminal whenever my
program is not working or not giving me the right output. I often time use debugging but still not perfect on that.
